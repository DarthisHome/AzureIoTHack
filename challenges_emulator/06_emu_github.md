# Introduction to GitHub

Later on, we are going to focus on the topics _DevOps_ and _Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment_. A tool for this is GitHub, which ist why we will now take a closer look at GitHub and its components.

In this chapter, you will learn about these topics:

- [GitHub organization](#github-organization)
- [GitHub repository](#github-repository)
- [Fork](#fork)
- [Clone](#clone)
- [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

## GitHub organization

A [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) is a shared account where team members of businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects. Owners and Administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with security and administrative features.

During the setup prework, you already created your own GitHub organization. This is the place, where you would invite team members and manage access to projects and repositories. For this hackathon, you aren't working in teams and therefore, do not need to add team members.

## GitHub repository

A GitHub [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.

During the day you are going to work with Git branches, commits and pull requests.
