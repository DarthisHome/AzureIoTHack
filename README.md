# Azure IoT Hackathon

Welcome! We plan to implement an Azure IoT solution with you.
To do so we have documented the process for you.
There are two ways to run through this Hackathon.

- Under **option 1** you will use a Raspberry Pi and a Sense HAT to retreive the necessary data. All the documentation will start with a **0**. So to set up for this option move to the [00_pi_setup.md](./00_pi_setup.md).
- Under **option 2** you will use an online emulator for the Raspberry Pi and an additional sensor. All the documentation will start with a **1**. So to set up for this option move to the [10_emulator_setup.md](./10_emulator_setup.md).

Please do the setup in advance since it will take some time.
